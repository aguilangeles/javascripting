/*
 You will often need to change the contents of a string.  
K   
  Strings have built-in functionality that allow you to inspect and  
  manipulate their contents.  
  Here is an example using the .replace() method:  
     var example = 'this example exists';  
     example = example.replace('exists', 'is awesome');  
     console.log(example);  
*/

var pizza ='pizza is alright';
pizza = pizza.replace('alright', 'wonderful');
console.log(pizza);
